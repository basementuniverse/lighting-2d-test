An experiment in rendering 2.5d shadow volumes.

![preview](preview.png "Preview")

Create:
* ShadowBases ('ground profiles' for objects in the world. these cast shadows on the ground and on walls. Press 'b')
* ShadowWalls (vertical surfaces facing down, ie. facing the camera. These receive shadows. Press 'w')
* Lights (cast coloured light. Press 'l')

Shadow bases and walls can be dragged around and resized (Ctrl & drag).
'a' / 'z' to raise or lower the height of a ShadowBase.
's' / 'x' to raise or lower the floor offset (height above the ground) of a ShadowBase.

Lights can also be dragged around and their radius resized (Ctrl & drag from center).
'a' / 'z' to cycle through Light colours.
